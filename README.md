## 🎯 Problem & Impact

### The Justice Gap in India

**4+ Crore Cases Pending** • **15 Lawyers per 10,000 People** • **65% Rural Population with Limited Legal Access**

Most Indians face three critical barriers to justice:

1. **Cost Barrier**: Legal consultation costs ₹500-5,000, document drafting ₹1,000-10,000 - unaffordable for majority
2. **Knowledge Barrier**: Complex legal jargon and IPC sections are incomprehensible to common citizens
3. **Access Barrier**: Rural areas lack lawyers, urban areas have long waiting times

### Our Solution & Innovation

Unlike generic chatbots, our AI is **specifically trained on Indian legal datasets** (IPC, RTI Act, court precedents) to provide:
- Context-aware explanations of 100+ IPC sections
- State-specific legal guidance for 5+ jurisdictions
- Instant FIR/RTI/Affidavit generation in court-ready format

#### 🔐 Blockchain for Legal Integrity
First-of-its-kind integration where every document gets:
- **SHA-256 cryptographic fingerprint** for tamper-proof evidence
- **Immutable timestamp** proving document authenticity
- **Secure sharing** with controlled access for lawyers/courts

#### ⚖️ Real-World Impact

| Use Case | Traditional Process | With NyaySetuAI | Impact |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| RTI Application | 2-3 days, ₹2,000-5,000 | 5 minutes, ₹0 | **99% time & cost reduction** |
| Legal Consultation | 1-2 weeks wait, ₹1,000+ | Instant, ₹0 | **Democratized access** |
| Document Verification | Prone to tampering | Blockchain-secured | **Court-admissible proof** |

### Why This Matters Now

- **Digital India Mission**: Aligns with government's push for digital governance
- **RTI Act Awareness**: Empowers citizens to hold authorities accountable
- **Access to Justice**: Constitutional right, now technologically enabled
- **Post-COVID Reality**: Remote legal assistance is no longer optional
